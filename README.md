# STATS_6371_Kaggle
This is shared space for the STATS 6371 kaggle project. 

I suggest we bring over a copy of each of the meeting minutes and store them in GIT by date.  There is a directory we can place the older minutes and just keep the most current version in the active directory


Items needed for project organization:

1) Description of project, the description should belong here in the README


2) Codebook, I just listed the codebook here for convenience but should become a section by itself
